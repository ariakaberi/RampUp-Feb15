      	In bed with my girl, staying up late. <br>
      	Long convos, nudging dormant memories awake.<br>
      	I stare into her eyes, get lost in the vibe. <br>
      	And start to realize, that she's way more than a hot chick.<br>
      	She's my spiritual locksmith, she's taught me how to live.<br>

      	<br> 
      	Learned to tame my inner deamons.<br>
      	Switched from pale ales to organic greens, <br>
      	Then, started to live within my means, cut back on the cheese. <br>
      	Expanded what I read, and refined my beliefs.<br>
      	I'm pruning in the garden of my mind. <br>
      	Changing how I re-act to stimuli. <br>

      	<br>
      	It's getting easier, now it seems effortless, <br>
      	Because when you change one thing, everything shifts. <br>
     	Butterfly effect, keystone habit. <br>
     	Call it what you want it feels like magic. <br>
     	Living fantastic, people ask me, "Ari how'd it happen?" <br>

     	<br>
     	I'm just more thoughtful with my actions, careful with my words. <br>
     	Starting to see myself in the third. <br>
     	Plan as I observe, then only impliment once its confirmed. <br>

     	<br>
     	It's not about the path of least resistance.  Nahh! <br>
     	It's about the consistency of your persistance. <br>
     	And the gravity of minute decisions. <br>
     	The gravity of minute decisions. <br>
